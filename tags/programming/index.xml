      <description>Asteroid chunk recycling is one of the the most effective methods to get legendary resources in Factorio. It is one of the more unique quality grinding setups you&amp;rsquo;ll ever find, but the calculations needed to assess the efficiency of this method are quite straightforward, as it will be shown in this blog post. Please note that I will assume that the reader has read my analysis of pure recyler loops.</description>

      <title>Solving the mathematics of Factorio Quality: Pure Recycler Loop</title>

      <description>The pure recycler loop is the simplest possible way to grind for legendary items, making it the logical next step of our quality analysis journey. Armed with the knowledge we gained from the previous post of this series, we&amp;rsquo;re going to calculate the efficiency of this quality grinding method and do some statistical analysis of how the production of quality items is affected by the quality chance of the recyclers.</description>

      <description>Prologue&#xD;Link to heading&#xD;Video games have this incredible ability to evoque certain feelings and states of mind on the people that play them. You can experience pretty much every emotion, starting from happiness, amazement, and wonder going all the way to sadness, frustation, and heartbreak. Games can make you laugh and cry, they can make you focus, and sometimes they make you think.&#xA;Factorio is a game that makes you think.</description>

      <title>Solving the Jindosh Riddle with constraint programming</title>

      <description>I was playing Dishonored II, when I came across a locked door. In order to make progress in the game, I had to open this door. When you get close to it, you begin to realise that there is more to this door than it first meets the eye:&#xA;The Jindosh Riddle door lock&#xD;There is no key that opens this door. Instead, you have 5 slots with names and 5 slots with objects which need to have the right values to unlock the door.</description>

      <title>Applying clustering techniques to the F1 2024 schedule for fun and profit</title>

      <description>I was finishing my Formula 1 Cornering Performance Breakdown project when I came up with the idea of using the existing code infrastructure to generate cornering data for every track on the 2024 calendar. As part of that project, I tagged every corner with a tag highlighting how fast that corner is. With that information, I can determine how much time is spent on each type of corner. The remainder of the time in lap, which isnâ€™t spent negotiating a corner, is the time the drivers spend at full throttle on a lap, tagged below as STRAIGHT.</description>

      <title>Developing an intermediate representation of Brainfuck using Rust</title>

      <description>Brainfuck is an interesting programming language, to say the least. As the most prominent Esoteric programming language out there, it provides a truly cursed programming experience. It is quite minimalistic as well, featuring only 8 distinct instructions and a programming model that can be best described as a glorified Turing machine, making writing a Brainfuck compiler an interesting programming exercise. However, we might as well go a step further and develop an intermediate representation for it, because, well, why not?</description>
