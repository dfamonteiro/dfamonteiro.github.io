      <description>The recycler-assembler loop is probably the most commonly used quality grinding method in Factorio. It is a two step looping process where in the first step, the ingredients are crafted by an assembler into items, which are then recycled back into ingredients. By having quality and productivity1 modules in both the assembling and the recycling steps, the quality and items and ingredients in the loop will eventually improve all the way to legendary quality.</description>

      <description>Asteroid chunk recycling is one of the the most effective methods to get legendary resources in Factorio. It is one of the more unique quality grinding setups you&amp;rsquo;ll ever find, but the calculations needed to assess the efficiency of this method are quite straightforward, as it will be shown in this blog post. Please note that I will assume that the reader has read my analysis of pure recyler loops.</description>

      <description>The pure recycler loop is the simplest possible way to grind for legendary items, making it the logical next step of our quality analysis journey. Armed with the knowledge we gained from the previous post of this series, we&amp;rsquo;re going to calculate the efficiency of this quality grinding method and do some statistical analysis of how the production of quality items is affected by the quality chance of the recyclers.</description>
