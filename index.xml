      <description>The 2020 Formula 1 championship was one of the most uncompetitive seasons in recent history. Facing an underpowered Ferrari1 and a RedBull plagued with rear instability problems, Mercedes in some people&amp;rsquo;s eyes had already won the title2 before even turning a wheel in a free practice session. Lewis Hamilton, however, did need to beat his teammate Valttery Bottas in order to win the driver&amp;rsquo;s championship, but anyone who watches F1 knows that Hamilton is simply on another level, compared to Bottas.</description>

      <title>Developing an intermediate representation of Brainfuck using Rust</title>

      <description>Brainfuck is an interesting programming language, to say the least. As the most prominent Esoteric programming language out there, it provides a truly cursed programming experience. It is quite minimalistic as well, featuring only 8 distinct instructions and a programming model that can be best described as a glorified Turing machine, making writing a Brainfuck compiler an interesting programming exercise. However, we might as well go a step further and develop an intermediate representation for it, because, well, why not?</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a third year software engineering student at FEUP (Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto).
I am currently interested in multithreaded programming, rocket control, orbital dynamics and in analysing mega constellations as distributed systems. As a fan of Formula 1 and Formula E, I enjoy analysing certain aspects of those championships and imagining what the future of motorsport will look like, on a technical level.
In my spare time, besides writing code, I enjoy playing games such as Kerbal Space Program, Factorio and blundering queens in chess.</description>
