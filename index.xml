      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, as part of a team-building activity, me and a bunch of work colleagues went to a karting track. The format was quite simple: 5 minutes of practice/qualifying, followed by a 15 minute race. I went to this karting affair with absolutely no racing experience other than playing Gran Turismo 5&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and watching way too much Formula 1, and did pretty well in qualifying, starting P3! Unfortunately my lack of experience surfaced during the race and I spun a couple of times in a tricky hairpin, and as a result I ended up P7 by the checkered flag.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Solving the mathematics of Factorio Quality: Recycler-Assembler Loop</title>

It is a two step looping process where in the first step, the ingredients are crafted by an assembler into items, which are then recycled back into ingredients. By having quality and productivity&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; modules in both the assembling and the recycling steps, the quality and items and ingredients in the loop will eventually improve all the way to legendary quality. Emulating a recycler-assembler loop is slightly more complex than the &lt;a href=&#34;https://dfamonteiro.com/posts/factorio-pure-recycler-loop/&#34; &gt;pure recycling loops&lt;/a&gt; we have dealt with previously, but the same fundamental ideas still apply. Please note that functions from previous blog posts will be reused here.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;script type=&#34;module&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    import mermaid from &#39;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mermaid@11/dist/mermaid.esm.min.mjs&#39;;&#xD;&#xA;    mermaid.initialize({ startOnLoad: true });&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/script&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Asteroid chunk recycling is one of the the most effective methods to get legendary resources in Factorio. It is one of the more unique quality grinding setups you&amp;rsquo;ll ever find, but the calculations needed to assess the efficiency of this method are quite straightforward, as it will be shown in this blog post. Please note that I will assume that the reader has read my analysis of &lt;a href=&#34;https://dfamonteiro.com/posts/factorio-pure-recycler-loop/&#34; &gt;pure recyler loops&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Armed with the knowledge we gained from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://dfamonteiro.com/posts/factorio-quality-1/&#34; &gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&#34;https://dfamonteiro.com/tags/factorio-quality/&#34; &gt;this series&lt;/a&gt;, we&amp;rsquo;re going to calculate the efficiency of this quality grinding method and do some statistical analysis of how the production of quality items is affected by the quality chance of the recyclers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

You can experience pretty much every emotion, starting from happiness, amazement, and wonder going all the way to sadness, frustation, and heartbreak. Games can make you laugh and cry, they can make you focus, and sometimes they make you &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Factorio is a game that makes you think. It gives such fascinating production and logistics challenges to its players that sometimes they stop playing and write &lt;a href=&#34;https://scholar.google.pt/scholar?hl=en&amp;amp;q=factorio&#34; title=&#34;Factorio research&#34;  class=&#34;external-link&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;research papers&lt;/a&gt; about the problems they face in this game&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was playing Dishonored II, when I came across a locked door. In order to make progress in the game, I had to open this door. When you get close to it, you begin to realise that there is more to this door than it first meets the eye:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;img src=&#34;https://dfamonteiro.com/images/Jindosh-Lock.png&#34; alt=&#34;Guia circuit track layout&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Jindosh Riddle door lock&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is no key that opens this door. Instead, you have 5 slots with names and 5 slots with objects which need to have the right values to unlock the door. You don&amp;rsquo;t have to brute force the combination, though, because right next to the door you can find the following riddle:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Applying clustering techniques to the F1 2024 schedule for fun and profit</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was finishing my &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/dfamonteiro/Formula-1-Cornering-Performance-Breakdown&#34;  class=&#34;external-link&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Formula 1 Cornering Performance Breakdown&lt;/a&gt; project when I came up with the idea of using the existing code infrastructure to generate cornering data for every track on the 2024 calendar. As part of that project, I tagged every corner with a tag highlighting how fast that corner is. With that information, I can determine how much time is spent on each type of corner. The remainder of the time in lap, which isnâ€™t spent negotiating a corner, is the time the drivers spend at full throttle on a lap, tagged below as &lt;strong&gt;STRAIGHT&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Formula 1 ATR rules have to account for dominance</title>
      <link>https://dfamonteiro.com/posts/f1-atr/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dominance is a common occurrence in Formula 1. While most other forms of motorsport have made efforts to limit the amount of design freedom that teams have (to save costs), F1 and MotoGP swim against the current and remain the only premier competitions where pretty much everything is bespoke&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. This leads to the creation of incredible works of engineering in the form of the fastest racing bikes and cars on this planet. Still, it also carries a grave risk of having a season entirely dominated by a manufacturer: RedBull has won 21/22 races in 2023, and Ducati had a similar MotoGP performance in the same year.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Formula 1&#39;s cost cap could be improved: here&#39;s how</title>
      <link>https://dfamonteiro.com/posts/cost-cap-f1/</link>

      <guid>https://dfamonteiro.com/posts/cost-cap-f1/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The introduction of the cost cap in Formula 1 has allowed teams to do something they aren&amp;rsquo;t exactly well known to do: turning a profit. F1 teams suddenly had a business case that made sense for the first time since the inception of the sport and instantly saw their valuations skyrocket. It has also meant that the bigger F1 outfits have had to downsize to fit the cost cap, which led to a couple of &lt;em&gt;interesting side effects&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Can Formula E race at Macau?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When it comes to historical races, the Monaco Grand Prix is definitely an odd one. Older than Formula 1 itself, it is F1&amp;rsquo;s most glamorous and most prestigious race on the calendar, featuring a track layout that remains largely unchanged&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; since the race&amp;rsquo;s inception in 1929. Unfortunately, when it comes to on-track action, it is an absolutely dreadful race, with cars that are impossible to race on this track. So, when Formula E announced that the full track layout would be used for the 2021 Monaco E-Prix, people were hopeful that the premier electric series would provide a good race in this historical venue.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How soon can a driver clinch the title: a nuanced analysis</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The 2020 Formula 1 championship was one of the most uncompetitive seasons in recent history. Facing an underpowered Ferrari&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and a RedBull plagued with rear instability problems, Mercedes in some people&amp;rsquo;s eyes had already won the title&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; before even turning a wheel in a free practice session. Lewis Hamilton, however, did need to beat his teammate Valttery Bottas in order to win the driver&amp;rsquo;s championship, but anyone who watches F1 knows that Hamilton is simply on another level, compared to Bottas. Ultimately, Hamilton clinched the title with three races to go at the Turkish Grand Prix with a memorable charge through the field. Watching this domination, I wondered to myself: what is the theoretical soonest that a championship can be wrapped up? Lets find out.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Developing an intermediate representation of Brainfuck using Rust</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Brainfuck is an interesting programming language, to say the least. As the most prominent &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language&#34; title=&#34;Esoteric programming language Wikipedia page&#34;  class=&#34;external-link&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Esoteric programming language&lt;/a&gt; out there, it provides a truly cursed programming experience. It is quite minimalistic as well, featuring only 8 distinct instructions and a programming model that can be best described as a glorified &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine&#34; title=&#34;Turing machine Wikipedia page&#34;  class=&#34;external-link&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Turing machine&lt;/a&gt;, making writing a Brainfuck compiler an interesting programming exercise. However, we might as well go a step further and develop an intermediate representation for it, because, well, why not?&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
